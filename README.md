# 🛍️ E-Commerce Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

## 📋 Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**.  
The goal is to identify behavioral patterns to help e-commerce or retail companies design personalized marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer characteristics and spending behavior.  
- Apply **K-Means** to group customers into distinct segments.  
- Visualize clusters to understand income–spending relationships.

---

## 🧩 Data Source
Dataset: *Mall Customers* from **Kaggle**  
It includes customer demographic information (Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score).

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-Learn**
- Notebook format: `.ipynb` (Google Colab / Jupyter)

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & EDA** – Inspect structure, handle missing values, visualize relationships.  
2. **Clustering** – Use Elbow Method to find optimal k and apply K-Means (5 clusters).  
3. **Visualization** – Plot clusters by Annual Income vs Spending Score.

## 📈 Insights
- **Cluster 0:** High income, high spending → “Premium Customers”  
- **Cluster 1:** High income, low spending → “Cautious Savers”  
- **Cluster 2:** Average income, average spending → “Standard Buyers”  
- **Cluster 3:** Low income, low spending → “Budget Shoppers”  
- **Cluster 4:** Low income, high spending → “Impulsive Buyers”
